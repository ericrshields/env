To set up CentOs:
	Obtain the latest "minimal" ISO from centos.org
	Use Rufus to create a bootable USB
	Make sure to turn on network config and set up a user.  Additional packages selected don't seem to accomplish anything
	sudo yum install epel-release && sudo yum update
	sudo yum install vim tree git httpd php php-mcrypt unzip ack screen
	Install env repo (git@github.com:/coldcandor/env.git)
		cd env && perl install.pl (follow the prompts)
		restart terminal
		
To set up webserver:
	sudo mkdir /public_html && sudo chown eshields:eshields /public_html
	git clone git@github.com:/coldcandor/website.git /public_html/www.coldcandor.com
	git clone git@github.com:/coldcandor/website.git /public_html/beta.coldcandor.com
	Switch the beta repo to the beta branch, tracking origin/beta
	run "apache_config"
	sudo systemctl enable httpd
	Disable or update iptables to allow http access
		sudo yum remove iptables
		sudo yum install NetworkManager (Because it apparently gets uninstalled as a dependency and I want the nmcli command - may no longer be needed)
	Disable SELinux or update extended permissions on public_html
		/etc/sysconfig/selinux - change "enforcing" to "permissive"
	Confirm DDNS has updated.  DNS is hosted at namecheap.com (if needed, domain is hosted via godaddy)
	Confirm Port Forwarding is set up correctly on router (server should be forced to 192.168.1.3)
		Most important is HTTP Server/80,8080 and SSH/22, but also FTP Server/21 and IRC/6666
	Turn on PHP errors in php.ini
	All webpages, except possibly gallery, should now be working

Setup Mysql:
	sudo yum install mariadb mariadb-server php-mysql
	sudo mysql_secure_installation
	sudo systemctl start mariadb
	sudo systemctl enable mariadb

	mysql -u root -p
	GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'eshields'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Setup IRC:
	Download ircd-hybrid and anope into ~/1
	extract both
	Move extracted files to /etc/ircd
	sudo yum install gcc
	sudo ./configure --prefix="/etc/ircd/"
	sudo make
	sudo make install
	copy ircd.conf to /etc/ircd
	create irc user:
		/etc/passwd: (vipw)
			irc:x:60:60:IRC Server:/etc/ircd:/sbin/nologin
		/etc/group: (vigr)
			irc:x:60:irc
		/etc/shadow: (vipw -s)
			irc:!!:16596::::::
	make directory /var/log/ircd and chown it to irc

	Setup a service and make it load on boot:
		sudo cp ~/env/not_symlinked/irc/ircd.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/
		sudo systemctl daemon-reload
		sudo systemctl enable ircd
	Or, start it manually (as user 'irc'):
		sudo -u irc /etc/ircd/bin/ircd -configfile /etc/ircd/ircd.conf -logfile /var/log/ircd/ircd.log

Magento-default setup:
	copy and extract magento archive to /public_html/work/magento-default
	copy and extract sample data anywhere, then copy it's media and skin folders to magento-default
	sudo yum install php-xml php-gd
	create database magento
	create mysql user:
		GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON magento.* TO 'magento'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'magento';
		FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	load sample data
		SOURCE <wherever the .sql file in the sample data folder resides>;
	run default_permissions on magento-default folder
	If getting non-permissions-based errors, check that mod_rewrite is enabled for apache
	ensure apache user has access to magento directory
	Add URL to hosts file on the machine being used to view the portal
	Load the core URL and Follow directions.  Make sure to select "use rewrites" and "skip URL validation"
	Revert folder permissions, if needed

	sudo curl -LsS http://files.magerun.net/n98-magerun-latest.phar -o /usr/local/bin/magerun
	sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/magerun
	(From magento base directory, follow prompts)  magerun admin:user:create

Other odds and ends:
	Setup Composer:
		(Note that this is an insecure install method and should only be done with implicit trust of the website)
		sudo curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin
		sudo mv /usr/local/bin/composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
		sudo yum install phpunit

	Setup Node.js (and grunt):
		sudo yum install nodejs nodejs-grunt
		(That was easy)

	Setup Symfony:
		(Same note as per composer)
		sudo curl -LsS http://symfony.com/installer -o /usr/local/bin/symfony
		sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/symfony
